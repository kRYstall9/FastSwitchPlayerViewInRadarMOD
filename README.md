# FastSwitchPlayerViewInRadarMOD

## Overview
The FastSwitchPlayerCamInRadar mod let's you switch each player's cam,while using the radar built in the in-game Terminal, by pressing some predefined hotkeys, such as:LeftArrow, RightArrow keys.

Pressing one of those keys automatically switches the radar cam to the chosen player's one without needing to type in the terminal the keyword "switch playerName".

## Change Log

*  ### 1.1.0 (Latest)
    - Added a clock on the top-right corner of the Terminal
    - Fixed a bug where being alone in a server resulted in some ArgumentOutOfRangeException while trying to switch radar map in the terminal
    - The clock text comes with 3 different colors:
      - Green (Default)
      - Orange (In the afternoon the clock turns orange)
      - Red (In the evening and night the clock turns red)
      -  Each color is swappable by changing the Hex Color Code inside the config file having the name of this mod.

* ### 1.0.3
  - Radar boosters, like players, are now visible in the terminal map
    
* ### 1.0.2

  - Bindable keys are now 2. The default binded keys are LeftArrow and RightArrow. LeftArrow let's you switch to the previous player's cam. RightArrow let's you switch to the next player's cam.
  - Cam is swappable without needing to type the keyword "view monitor" whenever the user leaves the terminal and then re-opens it.
 
## Some ideas that might be "good to have" in game
- [x] Clock displayed on the terminal
- [ ] Doors keyword (Opens or Closes the ship's doors)
- [ ] Ship loot value displayed on the terminal
- [ ] Moon name's red if you can't afford to buy the route, otherwise green
