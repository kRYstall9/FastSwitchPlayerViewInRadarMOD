# FastSwitchPlayerViewInRadarMOD

## Overview

The FastSwitchPlayerCamInRadar mod let's you switch each player's cam,while using the radar built in the in-game Terminal, by pressing some predefined hotkeys, such as: 0 through 9.

Pressing one of those keys automatically switches the radar cam to the chosen player's one without needing to type in the terminal the keyword "switch playerName".

At the moment the mod only works for lobbies with at most 10 players.
